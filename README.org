* Oral Qualifying Exam Presentation
This repo contains the code used to create the presentation given for my oral qualifying examination.

You can view the presentation [[https://lukebodm.github.io/oral_qualifying_exam/][here]].

This presentation was created using [[https://gitlab.com/oer/org-re-reveal][org-re-reveal]], an emacs package for creating [[https://revealjs.com/][reveal-js]] presentations from [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] documents.

The main file that I edit is the ~index.org~ file. This file is automatically compiled into the ~index.html~ file.

~custom.css~ is for adding my own css on top of the ~reveal.js~ styles.

~references.bib~ contains the BibTeX entries for my bibliography, and ~citation-styles.csl~ is for formatting my citation styles.  

The ~images/~ folder contains all the ~.png~ files that I created in [[https://inkscape.org/][inkscape]] for the presentation.
