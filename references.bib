    abstract = {Prestack seismic reflection data contain amplitudes, traveltimes, and moveout information; waveform inversion of such data has the potential to estimate attenuation levels, reflector depths and geometry, and background velocities. However, when inverting reflection data, strong nonlinearities can cause reflectors to be incorrectly imaged and can prevent background velocities from being updated. To successfully recover background velocities, previous authors have resorted to nonlinear, global search inversion techniques.We propose a two-step inversion procedure using local descent methods in which we perform alternate inversions for the reflectors and the background velocities. For our reflector inversion we exploit the efficiency of the back-propagation method when inverting for a large parameter set. For our background velocity inversion we use Newton inverse methods. During the background velocity inversions it is crucial to adaptively depth-stretch the model to preserve the vertical traveltimes. This reduces nonlinearity by largely decoupling the effects of the background velocities and reflectors on the data. Nonlinearity is further reduced by choosing to invert for slownesses and by inverting for a sparse parameter set which is partially defined using geological reflector picks.Applying our approach to shallow seismic data from the North Sea collected over a gas-sand deposit, we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to estimate both the geometry and internal velocity of a significant velocity structure not present in the initial model. Over successive iterations, the use of adaptive depth stretching corrects the pull-down of the base of the gas sand. Vertical background velocity gradients are also resolved. For an insignificant extra cost the acoustic attenuation parameter Q is included in the inversion scheme. The final attenuation tomogram contains realistic values of Q for the expected lithologies and for the effect of partial fluid saturation associated with a shallow bright spot. The attenuation image may also indicate the presence of fracturing.},

@misc{Vandekerckhove2016,
abstract = {In many application fields, non-destructive testing and evaluation (NDT&E) is useful to determine material properties and detect faults of objects before or during operation. In the past decades, a wide range of experimental NDT&E techniques has been developed and successfully tested for many problem classes. In the past few years, the collection of experimental NDT&E techniques has been extended with hybrid methods, i.e., methods that combine experiments and numerical simulation. The main drawback of all existing NDT&E methods, is that they need a-priori knowledge and expertise of the operator. In this work, we aim to develop automated procedures for the characterisation of material parameters based on the simulation of wave propagation problems, thereby extending the application range of NDT&E, especially to problems with little a-priori knowledge.
We propose the use of gradient based optimisation methods to develop automated procedures for the characterisation of material parameters. To achieve this, we first select efficient numerical procedures for the solution of wave propagation problems. For the spatial discretisation, we consider the finite integration technique and the finite element method with both continuous and discontinuous elements. We study the performance of several time integration methods in combination with these spatial discretisation methods, from which we learn that third order discontinuous elements in combination with second order time stepping methods are performing best.
We compute gradient information of the time-dependent wave propagation problem and use this in combination with the forward solver to efficiently solve the inverse problems that occur in NDT&E. For the efficient computation of gradients, adjoint methods are used. The proposed gradient based optimisation method is compared to gradient free methods for determining the wave speeds in a homogeneous isotropic medium, from which we conclude that gradient based methods are the only feasible option to tackle more complicated inverse problems. The challenges involved in solving optimisation problems with spatially dependent control parameters are described and successfully demonstrated for determining a spatially dependent wave speed distribution. We show that the use of proper function spaces and associated Riesz maps is a key ingredient to obtain correct results.
We also use gradient information to automatically calibrate absorbing layers to mimic open boundaries. The automatic calibration is performed for perfectly matched layers and for the simpler and computationally faster approach of using consecutive absorbing layers. We show that after calibration, both approaches have a comparable performance.
Throughout this work, we use a high level of genericity to describe and simulate wave propagation problems so that all presented methods are applicable to acoustic, electromagnetic and elastic wave propagation problems in one two and three dimensions. This work demonstrates that numerically solving inverse NDT&E problems with many, e.g. spatially dependent, parameters is possible.},

abstract = {Full Wave Inversion (FWI) imaging scheme has many applications in engineering, geoscience and medical sciences. In this paper, a surrogate deep learning FWI approach is presented to quantify properties of materials using stress waves. Such inverse problems, in general, are ill-posed and nonconvex, especially in cases where the solutions exhibit shocks, heterogeneity and discontinuities. The proposed approach is proven efficient to obtain global minima responses in these cases. This approach is trained based on random sampled sets of material properties and sampled trials around local minima, therefore, it requires a forward simulation can handle high heterogeneity, discontinuities and large gradients. High resolution Kurganov–Tadmor (KT) central finite volume method is used as forward wave propagation operator. Using the proposed framework, material properties of 2D media are quantified for several different situations. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method for estimating mechanical properties of materials with high accuracy using deep learning approaches.}
